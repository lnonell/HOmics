Hierarchical model to integrate omics data sets

This is a package to integrate prior knowledge to methylation/expression

It constructs a bayesian hierarchical model using the rjags interface to JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler), a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation) .

The installation of JAGS is straightforward using this link
